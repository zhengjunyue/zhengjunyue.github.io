### Bio ###
I am an Assistant Professor at the Speech Lab of Multimedia Computing Group at the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), the Netherlands. My research focus is Speech Technology for Healthcare. I received my B.Sc. degree in Telecommunication Engineering from Shanghai University, China, in 2017, and the M.Sc. degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom. I completed my PhD in the area of dysarthric speech recognition in the Speech and Hearing Group at the University of Sheffield, United Kingdom, funded by the Marie-Curie H2020 TAPAS project. After my PhD, I worked at King's College London (KCL), United Kingdom, as a postdoc funded by the British Engineering and Natural Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) SpeechWave project, focusing on robust dysarthric speech recognition using raw waveform acoustic modelling.
My research interests are pathological speech processing and recognition, , child speech analysis, conversational AI medical systems for healthcare, and multi-modal biomarkers for pathological speech.
